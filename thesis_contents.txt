    cap theorem
      our choice == distributed + available
    choices for distributed + available
      mongo db
      cassandra
      why cassandra
  feature detection + image recognition
    why separate server
    opencv
      feature detection
        sift detector
        surf detector
      feature matching
        brute force matcher
        flann matcher
      improving accuracy
        finding correct subsets of images
        clustering of features to remove uninteresting features
        interpreting the geometric properties of matches (translation + scale)
      hog detector?
    android opencv?
      sparse queries backed up by translations?
